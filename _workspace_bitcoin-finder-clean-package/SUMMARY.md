# Bitcoin Wallet Recovery Tool - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Bitcoin Wallet Recovery Tool is a specialized utility designed to search for Bitcoin wallets with specific word patterns in their mnemonics. This tool is particularly useful for recovering lost wallets when you remember certain words from your seed phrase but not the exact order or all words.

## Key Features

1. **Custom Word List Filtering**: Search for mnemonics containing specific words from your custom list
2. **Multiple Derivation Paths**: Supports various Bitcoin address types and derivation paths
3. **Learning System**: Adaptive search that improves efficiency over time
4. **Checkpoint System**: Save and resume searches from checkpoints
5. **Health Monitoring**: Monitors system resources and performance
6. **Service Mode**: Run as a continuous service with automatic checkpointing

## Project Accomplishments

1. **Code Fixes**: Successfully resolved compilation errors in the original code:
   - Fixed trait bounds for HashMap keys
   - Resolved UnwindSafe implementation issues
   - Addressed moved value errors
   - Updated deprecated API usage
   - Aligned dependency versions

2. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation:
   - Detailed user guide (GUIDE.md)
   - Quick-start README.md
   - Example scripts for different use cases

3. **Testing Resources**: Developed testing materials:
   - Sample word lists
   - Sample address database
   - Example configuration files
   - Test scripts for different scenarios

## How to Use the Tool

### Basic Usage

1. Build the tool:
   ```bash
   cd bitcoin-finder-fixed
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run a basic search:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/bitcoin-finder -c config.json -w wordlist.txt -d btcdatabase.txt
   ```

### Advanced Usage

1. Run with learning mode:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/bitcoin-finder -c config.json -w wordlist.txt -d btcdatabase.txt --learning-mode
   ```

2. Run in service mode with auto-resume:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/bitcoin-finder -c config.json -w wordlist.txt -d btcdatabase.txt --service-mode --auto-resume
   ```

### Example Scripts

We've provided several example scripts in the `examples` directory:

1. `basic_search.sh`: Simple search with minimal configuration
2. `advanced_search.sh`: Advanced search with learning features
3. `service_mode.sh`: Running as a service with automatic checkpointing

## Configuration Options

The tool is highly configurable through the JSON configuration file. Key options include:

- `min_matching_words`: Minimum number of words from the word list that must be present
- `max_addresses_per_path`: Maximum number of addresses to generate per derivation path
- `learning_enabled`: Enable the learning system to improve search efficiency
- `adaptive_search`: Enable adaptive search based on learning
- `paths_to_check`: List of derivation paths to check

## Project Files

1. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md`: Quick overview and usage instructions
   - `GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive user guide
   - `SUMMARY.md`: Project summary and accomplishments

2. **Example Files**:
   - `examples/basic_wordlist.txt`: Simple word list for testing
   - `examples/advanced_wordlist.txt`: Comprehensive word list
   - `examples/sample_addresses.txt`: Sample Bitcoin addresses
   - `examples/basic_config.json`: Simple configuration
   - `examples/advanced_config.json`: Advanced configuration
   - `examples/service_config.json`: Service mode configuration

3. **Example Scripts**:
   - `examples/basic_search.sh`: Basic search example
   - `examples/advanced_search.sh`: Advanced search example
   - `examples/service_mode.sh`: Service mode example

## Conclusion

The Bitcoin Wallet Recovery Tool is now fully functional and ready for use. The fixed code compiles successfully and includes all the original functionality plus comprehensive documentation and examples. Users can now effectively search for Bitcoin wallets with specific word patterns in their mnemonics, with options for advanced features like learning and checkpointing.
